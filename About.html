        <h2>About Us</h2>
        
          <p>Aishwi Technologies PVT LTD was founded on March 24, 2021, and is primarily focused on artificial intelligence. We have undertaken a project called UHID, an app for patient health records based on AI. Additionally, we have supported a project called Swayam for the Union Ministry of Education. Our company has developed a separate set of tools, including accounting tools based on AI. These tools are designed for ZOHO to facilitate ledger and account book management with the assistance of AI, reducing the need for extensive human workforce. Furthermore, we have collaborated with Company Netenrich Technologies on the Swayam 2.0 project, aimed at providing education support for underprivileged individuals. This collaboration was conducted in partnership with the Union Ministry of Education and is considered one of the most prestigious projects for our company. On January 7, 2024. We have accounting software called Ankapal, used for creating invoices and facilitating direct GST returns through websites. Ankapal employs AI for ledger creation, helping eliminate fake invoices. A brief explanation of UHID: UHID stands for Unique Health Identification System. It is designed to maintain the health records of patients through a government-issued unique identification number. This system proves highly useful for doctors, allowing them easy access to the past health records of patients. Our future projects include Swayam 2.0, Ravi Shankar Group, BMR Group, and a gadget for the police, which is very helpful for their investigations. On January 7, 2024, we collaborated with IQinternz
